## Getting Started

To get started you will need nvm installed. Follow the link below for setup:

[nvm setup guide](https://gist.github.com/d2s/372b5943bce17b964a79)

There are three main scripts in ``` package.json ```

1. ``` npm run dev ``` generates assets and puts them in the ``` /dist ``` folder. Meant for development.
2. ``` npm run prod ``` same as former but compresses and optimizes the output assets. Meant for production.
3. ``` npm run server ``` generates assets and host them at [localhost:9000](https://localhost:9000/). Watches file changes and auto-compile them.

### Installing

First install the packages with

```
nvm use
npm install
```

Next let's get the server up and running

```
npm start
```

## Running the tests
