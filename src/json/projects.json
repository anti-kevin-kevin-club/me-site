      "description": "The goal of the project is to develop a real-time speech-to-text service that automates the process of live captioning in classNameroom for hard of hearing students. The tech stack employs react with node express as web services and a mongo database to store notes. Speech-to-text process is done by IBM Watson through its web API. The app enables users to choose a className to tune in and experience live captioning from the browser."
